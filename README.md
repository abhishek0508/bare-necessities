## Localising Essentials in the Times of Coronavirus 

 

 

### Problem Statement  

With the current situation of a national lockdown, we have a lot of issues arising with respect to resources. We aim to research the situation on the ground, the happenings and figure out solutions to help people localize resources in contrast to the usual globalization. 

People do not know where to go to get essential supplies like groceries and medicines, as it is unclear which shops in their locality are open, what are their timings, and they cannot venture out far to check all of this on their own.  

To aid people in these times of crisis, our objective is to create a mobile app that would let users know which shops and facilities are currently operational in their neighborhood. 

 

 

### Solution Overview 

The users will input open times, close times and the type of shop (Supermarket, local Kirana store, Petrol station, Medical store etc.) based on their visits or if they are the owners. This information will be saved on a database.  

Whenever somebody wants to get something, they will search for their item of need (rice, vegetables, medicines etc.). Based on what type of store it is (supermarkets stock groceries, toiletries; petrol stations will have diesel, petrol; etc.) the application will give a list of all open, nearby places based on a radius.
